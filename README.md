# myContactsBackend
This is my first backend project on NodeJS which deals with the creation, updation and deletion of a contact list of a user who can log in and with safety use it.

first of all, one need to install node modules using command - npm install

Then, one can install the following dependencies on VS Code if not woking 
npm install express
npm i -D nodemon
* Download express async handler and mongoose using-
npm i express-async-handler
npm i mongoose
* For Password hashing- npm i bcrypt
*Now, for login and all, install web token by the command - 
 npm i jsonwebtoken

Go to package.json and in the script, add-
"start": "node server.js",
"dev": "nodemon server.js"

then, finally npm run dev

One can use any client for testing this backend. I used Thunder Client which is there on VS Code
